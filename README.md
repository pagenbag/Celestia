# Celestia: The Infinite Observatory

Celestia is an incremental star-mapping game where you explore a procedurally generated universe. Using the power of the Gemini API, every star, nebula, and black hole you discover is unique, complete with scientific descriptions and generated lore.

## Core Loop

1.  **Gather Starlight**: Initially, you must manually "Gaze at the Void" to collect Starlight. This is your primary currency for hardware upgrades.
2.  **Manage Focus**: Your telescope requires Focus (energy) to perform Deep Scans. Focus regenerates over time.
3.  **Deep Scan**: Spend Focus and Starlight to scan a sector. This discovers a new celestial body.
    *   *Note*: As you map more of the universe, scanning becomes more difficult. Use upgrades to mitigate the increasing costs and time delays.
4.  **Analyze**: Use Data resource to perform a Deep Analysis on specific bodies, revealing detailed scientific composition and lore generated by AI.
5.  **Upgrade**: Improve your observatory's capabilities to see further and faster.

## Resources

*   **Starlight (Lummens)**: The raw light gathered from the cosmos. Used to purchase equipment upgrades and power scans.
*   **Focus**: The operational energy of your telescope array. Regenerates over time. Required to initiate scans.
*   **Data (Bytes)**: Information gathered from discoveries. Used to perform deep analysis on interesting targets.

## Progression Mechanics

### The Expanding Universe
As you discover more celestial bodies, you are effectively looking "deeper" into space. 
*   **Scan Cost**: The Focus and Starlight required to find a new star increases linearly with the number of known bodies.
*   **Scan Time**: Signals take longer to return from deep space. The time required to scan increases significantly as your map grows.

### Celestial Tiers
The type of object you discover depends on how deep you have explored:
*   **Early Game**: Mostly Stars (various spectral classes).
*   **Mid Game**: Nebulae and complex star systems begin to appear.
*   **Late Game**: Rare anomalies, Galaxies, and Black Holes with event horizons can be found.

### Constellations
The Star Map automatically draws constellation lines between stars that are visually close to one another, helping you track clusters within the infinite void.

## Equipment Upgrades

| Upgrade | Type | Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lens Polishing** | Active | Increases Starlight gained per manual click. |
| **Sensor Array** | Passive | Automatically gathers Starlight over time. |
| **Focus Condenser** | Battery | Increases your Maximum Focus capacity, allowing for more expensive deep scans. |
| **Gravimetric Stabilizers** | Battery | Increases Focus regeneration rate. Essential for frequent scanning. |
| **Deep Scan Matrix** | Processor | Reduces the time penalty for deep space scans. |
| **Quantum Processor** | Processor | Reduces the Data cost required for Deep Analysis. |

## Technology Stack

*   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
*   **Visualization**: D3.js for the interactive Star Map
*   **AI Engine**: Google Gemini API (via `@google/genai`) for procedural generation of celestial bodies and scientific analysis.
